It is important to choose a license for a number of reasons. First off, it protects your rights for the code you've written. For example if a company wants to use the code you wrote, the license protects you for commercial use. Second, it increases ease of collaboration between open source developers for improvement, distribution and education.

You shouldn't use a project without a license because its terms of use are unclear. Perhaps if you use it the creator could try and claim some form of copyright, leaving a portion of your program unreliable. Additionally, projects without licenses are more likely to be unmaintained or be removed by the creator.

Based on reading the article, I think the two main reasons Gopher did not make it was not opening up their code and product to a wide audience (open source concerns) as well as their implementation of hyperlinks. In today's world, hyperlinks are incredibly important, as googles main algorithm sifts through the massive amounts of websites by finding the relevant ones which are linked to more often. As google pretty much ties the web as we know it together, it seems obvious that a platform with poor integration of what makes the web the "web" (interconnection of sites through hyperlinks) would fail early on.

Since SailfishOS is being designed for a tablet, there are a couple reasons it makes sense for it to not be open source, first off, most tablets today operate within a walled garden approach, which appeals to many consumers, by making the OS proprietary, it removes the chance of security vulnerabilities being exposed. Additionally, SailfishOS needs to protect its software from players in the industry with greater resources. If they released the code, whats to stop Apple or another large company which can more easily make electronics from copying the innovations they have produced.

LGPL would be best for companies, as it allows for patent claims, create a warranty, and commercial use. It also applies more to libraries, which a large company would be more inclined to create, and then distribute as a product. Apache would be best for the common good, as it is free to be modified, relicensed, and distributed. This lack of restrictions opens up the passage of information and code. The last one, GPL, would be best for developers, it also includes patent claims, a warranty clause and commercial use like LGPL, although changes must be tracked in new releases, making it easier for developers to understand the edits.
